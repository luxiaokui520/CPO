- Varient discription:

  
  -- The library should support multiple-dispatch on positional, optional and named arguments.
  
  -- The library should be well documented.  
  
  -- Use unit tests with several multi-methods, which works with standard Python types and user-defined types-Demonstrate how it works with inheritances and multiple inheritances.

- synopsis:

   We designed the multi-dispatch library using decorators and multi-method classes. It can supports multiple-dispatch on positional, 
   optional and named arguments. In the file of test,we test the "foo" function by using named arguments ,and we can use "foo" function regardless 
   of number of parameters. Also,inheritance is demonstrated by inheriting and extending class decorators.
   
 ## Conclusion
 
 - It can be annotated with @multimethod to assign functions according to different types of arguments and 
   pass optional ,positional and named parameter tests.Multiple-dispatch is initially achieved.
